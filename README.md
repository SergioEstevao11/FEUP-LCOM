## Project Overview

Penguin Run is a platform game with a design inspired by SuperTux, where a penguin needs to get from one end of the scenery to another without falling in the water or colliding with obstacles. This game makes use of the UNIX systems' timer, keyboard, mouse, video card, and RTC, which had to be manually programmed and tuned.
